#  Hi, I'm RudraShiva-S (Sanjay Kumar)

##  Java Backend Developer | 

 I’m a passionate backend developer with over an experience building scalable, secure, and high-performance Java applications. My expertise lies in designing robust RESTful APIs, implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, and integrating cloud solutions.
 
 I've had the opportunity to work on enterprise applications, contributing to their growth through Spring Boot, microservices, and API development. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver seamless, secure solutions and am always eager to learn and adopt best practices.

---- **Development Philosophy:** Clean, testable code. Security-first design. Agile methodologies.
